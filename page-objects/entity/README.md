### Note about "entities"

Abstraction "entity" represent such things as portfolio, project, etc.
They all have similar pages and UI, and differ mostly by actions which must be performed to get to the entity page.

So to prevent code duplication and unnecessary amount of page objects and steps, they all are represented by entity page objects.
